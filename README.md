# NullTab

**A new browsing experience that replaces tab chaos with intelligent organization.**

## Overview

NullTab reimagines web browsing by replacing manual tab management with automatic categorization. Instead of juggling dozens of tabs across multiple windows, NullTab provides a single, organized flow where tabs are automatically grouped, saved, and retrievable.

## Core Concept

- **Single window, infinite tabs**: All tabs cached and organized automatically
- **Category-based organization**: Tabs auto-grouped by topic using ML clustering
- **Smart persistence**: Built-in "save for later" instead of external bookmark managers
- **Stale tab management**: Automatic cleanup based on usage patterns

## Key Features

### Organization

- Automated tab grouping (k-means clustering)
- Drag-and-drop category reassignment
- Importance ranking based on save frequency
- Domain ranking (PageRank-inspired)
- Sort by last visited with visual indicators

### Intelligence

- AI-powered tab search and retrieval
- Chat interface to find and organize tabs
- Confidence in retrieval: users can trust they'll find tabs later

### Power User Features

- Hotkey support for quick actions
- Detailed metadata view
- Scripting support (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- New tab page takeover
- Time-based analytics and graphs

### Sync

- Cross-device synchronization
- Merge conflict resolution UI

## Differentiation

**vs. Traditional Bookmarks**: Goes beyond simple URL saving with context, importance ranking, and automatic organization

**vs. Traditional Tabs**: Reduces cognitive load by eliminating manual sorting and window management

## Name Origin

"Null" represents zero clutter, a blank slate, and compression of tab chaos down to a focused, clean browsing experience.
