Reference: https://jcbl.ws/chrome-extension-react-devtools

Chrome manifest v3 doesn't allow external scripts, so we have to locally import the react-devtools script for it to connect to the devtools panel.

Redownload the script from http://localhost:8097/ if the `react-devtools` dependency is updated.
